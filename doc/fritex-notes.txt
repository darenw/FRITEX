FRITEXP = FRactional ITeration of EX{onentials
Software for computing fractionally iterated exponentials and generalized
arithmetic operations, and making nice plots

See my paper "Generalized Arithmetic Operator Parametrized by a Real Number" 
available as a PDF on the FRITEXP github repo, or my personal site www.darenscotwilson.com


Source Code 
----------------

Source code for computing these functions, and making data plots and other
handy actions, is organized by language.  For each, there is one file for the
Szekeres-defined functions, one for the Symmetry-based functions, and
other files for 


py   Python
go   Go language  (www.golang.org)
D    D language  (www.dlang.org)
js   Javascript, with html demo



Brief ascii-math re-organized overview of main ideas from the paper
-------------------------------------------------------------------
We define exp_u(x) according to:
   exp_0(x) = x
   exp_1(x) = exp(x)
   exp_a(exp_b(x)) = exp_c(x) where c=a+b
This is "solved" by use of either Abel's equation
   A(f (x)) = A(x) + 1  with f = exp
or the logically equivalent Shroeder's equation 
   L(f (x)) = cL(x)  
with f=exp and c= 1/2
These equations are "loose" in that only values of A at integer
spacings are related. Random functions of period 1 may be used to 
define alternative solutions. 

One solution, by Szekeres, fixes A by demanding non-changing signs of all
orders of derivatives for B, the Abel function for exp(x)-1, which has a
fixpoint at zero.  Power series are developed, approximations made, and
an algorithm found to calculate exp_u(x) for arbitrary real u and x.

Another solution is determined by a simple symmetry, 1 = L(x) + L(-x), 
This leads to an algorithm involving generalized integer-order inverses and
integer-iterated exp and log functions.  One starts with x, computes a 
sequence of iteration counts, then converts that to the value of L. Likewise
for the inverse of L.

L has unbounded derivates, a strangely fractal-like appearance, except 
using exp along one dimension instead of scaling.  I believe the function L
and its inverse to be smooth, that is continuous to all orders of derivatives, 
but have no proof.  Maybe I'll work on that someday.


Exp_u(x) is used to define a generalized "arithmetic" operator. 
In the way the logarithms are used to convert multiplication to addition,
we have for any real u:
    x op_u y  = exp_u( exp_{-u}(x) + exp_{-u}(y) )
As * and + form a field, so do the "next" operator after * and *.

Several suggestions for further research are given, including new orders
of asymptotic growth greater than polynomial but less than exponential,
but not like existing forms such as exp(sqrt(x)).

Best of all, there are no known practical applications. Perfectly pure math!
