"""
Functions to compute fractionally iterated exponentials and related things
These follow the "symmetry based" definition, where the Schr√∂der function
is made to obey L(-x) + L(x) = 1 and L(exp(x)) = (1/2)L(x)

Although not stated in the individual function docstrings, beware that exceptions
may be thrown.  We're performing iterated exponentials which can easily overflow,
and iterated logarithms that could bad.  The "if" and "while" statements take care
of all the normal cases I encountered, but maybe I missed some crazy corner cases.

These functions are not guaranteed to be exact and precise and good and true, but
seem to work fine.  No thorough testing has been done (yet) and no attempt has been
made to make them bullet-proof, or capable of handling other than scalar real values
or in some places lists or arrays. Use at your own risk. Do not use for heart-lung
machines, billion dollar NASA spacecraft, or anything serious, without thorough testing.

		Compute sequence of generalized inverses for a given x.
		The result is to be fed into LfromS() to obtain L,

		Use LfromX() if all you want is L.
		
		Args:
			x     (real):  -inf to +inf
			nmax  (int):   Maximum length for sequence.  default 25. 
			tau   (real):  How close to zero for terminating S.
			
		Returns:
			List of integers, mostly ranging from 1 to 5 or so.
			Length will never exceed nmax.
		
		Each element in S is worth about two or three bits. 25 elements is then
		worth about 50 to 75 bits, maybe more. That should cover IEEE double floats,

		Note that "large" integers in S, for example six, will effectively cut
		off the list there - you might as well not bother with that element and 
		anything after, when using normal IEEE 64-bit (or 80-bit) floats.
		If you use some super high precision form of binaryized real numbers,
		then have fun! You may be able to use S elements as high as 7 maybe 8. 
		
		Remember, the value of each element in S corresponds to tapping the 'exp'
		key on a calculator that number of times. This overflows quick!

		Compute Schroder function value L from a given sequence.

		that, there probably is a slicker way to code LfromS().

			epsilon (real):    smallest change in L you don't care about.
		Returns:
			Sequence as list of integers
		
		Normally epsilon should be 2 ** -(number of significant bits in L), and for
		IEEE 64-bit that's 52 bits (the rest being sign and exponent).
		Fearing trouble with round-offs, I set the default to 50 bits.
